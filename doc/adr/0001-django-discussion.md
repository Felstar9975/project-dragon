#####Title - Django framework

#####Status - Proposed (Kieran)

#####Context:
Given that we need to take into account security of users Django is
widely used and makes several security claims
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/security/

The client has expressed an interest in supporting free and open
source software, which Django is.

#####Consequences:
This would mean that Django will be front and centre of the
development process, everyone who works on the code will need
to be familiar with it.

Django only officially supports SQL based databases, so we need to
determine how much flexibility will be needed.
